Things to do:
Right justify user info
Replace phoenix icon with custom one
Make the post creation not error out

Lock post editing to the creator(s) of the post

Make posts more complex. They should have:
    Title
    Blurb
    Thumbnail
    Body
    Tags
    nice to haves:
    Inline images in body, maybe some nice formats to edit in, markup, latex, etc.
    More than 1 author
Title, thumbnail, and blurb are visible on home page scroll

Messaging system (maybe a phoenix module already?)
    Users need to message one another anonymously
    Inbox
    Groups

All posts seen by a user should be logged
