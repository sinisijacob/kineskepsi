# Kineskepsi

Kineskepsi is a hobby project to create a job-board like meeting place for different roles of entrepreneurial-minded individuals. Here they can post availability of time, money, or ideas in order to collaborate on business ventures together.

This project serves the purpose of being a learning/testing ground for deployment and scaling of applications via phoenix/elixir deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

A working example is hosted [here](https://kineskepsi.fly.dev/posts)
